A conversion tool is software designed to convert files from one format to another, ensuring compatibility and accessibility across different applications. Here’s a brief description of common types of conversion tools:

PDF to Word: Converts PDF documents into editable Word (.docx) files, allowing users to make changes to the text, formatting, and images.

Word to PDF: Converts Word documents into PDF format for easier sharing and consistent formatting across different platforms.

JPG to PDF: Converts image files (JPEG/JPG) into PDF format, often used for creating documents from image files.

JPG to Word: Converts image files into editable Word documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

Word to JPG: Converts Word document pages into image format (JPG), useful for sharing or embedding.

Image Compression: Reduces the file size of images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) without significantly affecting quality, making them easier to share and store.

PDF Compression: Reduces the size of PDF files by optimizing images, fonts, and other content, helping to save storage space and improve upload/download speeds.

We used a python libaray like streamlit. 


Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that allows developers to quickly build and share interactive web applications for data science, machine learning, and other purposes with minimal effort. It’s especially useful for creating apps that visualize data, perform file conversions, and showcase machine learning models in real time. Here’s how Streamlit can be used to build conversion tools like PDF to Word, image compression, etc.


Benefits of Using Streamlit for Building Conversion Tools:


No Web Development Expertise Needed: Focus purely on Python code, and Streamlit handles the UI and deployment.


Fast Prototyping: Quickly build and iterate on tools without worrying about backend complexities.


Interactivity: Users can easily interact with the tool in real time (e.g., uploading files, seeing results immediately).


Deployment: Easy to deploy and share as a web app with minimal setup.
